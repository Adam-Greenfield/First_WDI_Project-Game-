# First_WDI_Project-Game-
The first project i undertook for WDI at General assembly, a JS based video game

A one to two player game based heavily on pokemon
players both choose a chicken using the choose chicken button, alternatively choose a player one chicken then click foght the computer
click fight
Player one selects move first, then player two
if player two selects a move first, player one's move is the same as the last turn
keep selecting moves untill a chicken has been knocked out

This project was a ton of fun for me, the best thing about it is that I really want to keep developing it after project week is over, I want to add images and effects and move descriptions and the list goes on

I realise I learnt a lot of java script in the past two weeks, I was using arrays, nested functions, .this and many more techniques reasonable naturally.

If i were to do it again I would have focused a bit more on the user interface and ease of use, which will be implemented as soon as I get the chance

I remember one week ago we were set a task with a bonus objective of giving it an AI and I thought "Wow, that's crazy, when will I be able to do something like that?". Turns out the answer was one week later. I feel my grip of development is getting stronger and stronger and I can't wait to see how much I will have learnt after 10 more weeks! Anything is possible

A struggle was debugging in general, little things like misspellings and calling functions took a lot of time, but I learnt new debugging techniques along the way.
